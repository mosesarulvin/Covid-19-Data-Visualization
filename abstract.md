# Title: Covid 19 Data Visualization using Python 

# This project is proposed to present the visual representation of corona cases recorded all over the world. so it defined a way to visualize the data by then laymen could understand. 

# it takes data from disease.sh an open API for disease-related statistics then data cleaning process is done by using python pandas and NumPy to analyze the data it uses scipy library and it uses matplotlib, plotly and geoplotlib to visualize the data.
